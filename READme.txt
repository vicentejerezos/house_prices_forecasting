THIS DATASET CONTAINS 79 EXPLANATORY VARIABLES DESCRIBING ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF RESIDENCIAL HOMES IN AMES, LOWA. OUR GOAL IS TO 
CORRECTLY PREDICT THE FINAL PRICE OF EACH HOME

## PROJECT PLANNING 

1) UNDERSTAND NATURE OF THE DATA
2) HISTOGRAMS,BOXPLOT,SCATTERPLOT,COUNTPLOT...
3) VALUE COUNTS.
4) MISSING DATA.
5) CORRELATION BETWEEN THE METRICS.
6) IMPORTANT THEMES:
    6.1) IS THE OVERALL QUALITY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR?
    6.2) IS HOW MANY CARS FIT IN THE GARAGE IMPORTANT?
    6.3) IS TOTAL SURFACE IMPORTANT?
    6.4) IS HOW MANY FULL BATHS HAVE THE HOUSE IMPORTANT?
    6.5) IS HOW MANY ROOMS IMPORTANT?
    6.6) IS YEAR OF BUILT IMPORTANT?
    6.7) IS YEAR OF REMODELATION IMPORTANT?
    6.8) BETWEEN YEAR OF BUILT AND YEAR OF REMODELATION WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT?
    6.9) PEOPLE REALLY PAY HUGE AMOUNT OF MANY FOR HAVING A POOL?

7) FEATURE ENGINEERING.
8) OUTLIERS.
9) SKEW.
